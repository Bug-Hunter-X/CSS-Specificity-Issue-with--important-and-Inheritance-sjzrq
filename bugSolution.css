The solution involves restructuring the CSS to avoid the use of `!important` whenever possible.  In this specific case, we can achieve the desired effect by re-ordering selectors or using a more specific selector for the desired styling without `!important`:

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.child {
  color: red;
}

.child .grandchild {
  color: green !important; /*Now this will work as expected*/
}

/*Alternatively, if you want to avoid !important entirely*/
.parent .child .grandchild {
  color: green;
}
```

This revised CSS ensures that the grandchild element's style is applied correctly, demonstrating how avoiding `!important` whenever possible improves maintainability and predictability.
